    <h1>Accounting for Partnership Firms</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Partnership Firm Overview</h2>
    <p>Partnership is a type of business where two or more people work together and share profits and losses. (Partnership ek aisa business hota hai jisme do ya do se zyada log milkar kaam karte hain aur profit-loss share karte hain.)</p>
    
    <h2>2. Types of Partners</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Partner:</strong> A partner who manages the business. (Jo business ko manage karta hai.)</li>
        <li><strong>Sleeping Partner:</strong> A partner who invests money but does not manage the business. (Jo paisa lagata hai par business nahi chalata.)</li>
        <li><strong>Nominal Partner:</strong> A partner whose name is used in the business but does not invest or manage. (Jiska naam business me use hota hai, par wo invest ya manage nahi karta.)</li>
        <li><strong>Secret Partner:</strong> A partner who is actively involved in the business but is not known to outsiders. (Jo business me actively involved hota hai, par logon ko nahi pata hota.)</li>
        <li><strong>Minor Partner:</strong> A partner who can only share profits, not losses. (Jo sirf profit ka hissa le sakta hai, loss nahi uthata.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Partnership Deed</h2>
    <p>A written agreement between partners that includes details like profit sharing, capital investment, interest, salary, etc. (Ek written agreement hota hai jisme partners ke beech profit sharing, capital investment, interest, salary wagairah likha hota hai.)</p>
    
    <h2>4. Accounting Adjustments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Profit is shared equally if no agreement is made. (Agar koi agreement nahi hai, to profit barabar share hoga.)</li>
        <li>Interest on capital is given only if mentioned in the agreement. (Capital pe interest sirf tab milega jab agreement me likha hoga.)</li>
        <li>Interest on drawings is charged only if mentioned in the agreement. (Drawings pe interest sirf tab katega jab agreement me likha hoga.)</li>
        <li>Salary or commission to partners is given only if mentioned in the agreement. (Partner ko salary ya commission sirf tab milega jab agreement me likha hoga.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Methods of Capital Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed Capital:</strong> Capital account remains constant, and a separate current account is maintained. (Capital account alag hota hai aur ek Current Account maintain hota hai.)</li>
        <li><strong>Fluctuating Capital:</strong> Capital account keeps changing. (Capital account barabar change hota rehta hai.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Goodwill in Partnership</h2>
    <p>Goodwill represents the reputation of the firm and is calculated using Average Profit, Super Profit, or Capitalization methods. (Goodwill ka matlab hota hai firm ki reputation, jo Average Profit, Super Profit, ya Capitalization method se calculate hoti hai.)</p>
    
    <h2>7. Admission of a New Partner</h2>
    <p>When a new partner joins, they bring capital and goodwill. Assets and liabilities are revalued, and old partners compensate using the sacrificing ratio. (Agar naya partner aata hai to wo capital aur goodwill laata hai. Assets-liabilities ka revaluation hota hai, aur old partners sacrificing ratio ke according apna hissa dete hain.)</p>
    
    <h2>8. Retirement/Death of a Partner</h2>
    <p>When a partner retires or dies, their share is calculated, and the remaining partners compensate according to the gaining ratio. (Agar koi partner retire ho ya uski death ho jaye to uska hissa nikala jata hai, aur baaki partners gaining ratio ke according uska share lete hain.)</p>
    
    <h2>9. Dissolution of a Partnership Firm</h2>
    <p>If a firm is permanently closed, liabilities are cleared first, then capital is returned to partners, and the remaining balance is distributed among them. (Agar firm band hoti hai to pehle liabilities clear ki jati hain, fir partners ko capital return hoti hai, aur jo bacha wo partners me share ho jata hai.)</p>
