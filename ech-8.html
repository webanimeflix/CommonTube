        <h1>Economic Reforms & Current Challenges - Detailed Summary</h1>
        
        <h2>Economic Reforms Since 1991</h2>
        <p><strong>Economic Crisis of 1991:</strong> India faced a severe financial crisis due to high fiscal deficit, low foreign exchange reserves, and rising inflation. (1991 me Bharat ko bhari arthik sankat ka samna karna pada, jisme foreign exchange reserves kam ho gaye aur fiscal deficit badh gaya.)</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction of Economic Reforms:</h2>
        <p>To overcome the crisis, the Indian government introduced Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG) under the New Economic Policy. (Sankat se nikalne ke liye sarkar ne naye reforms laaye jo LPG policy kehlaye.)</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features of Economic Reforms:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Liberalization:</strong> Reduced government restrictions on businesses and trade.</li>
            <li><strong>Privatization:</strong> Transfer of public sector enterprises to private ownership.</li>
            <li><strong>Globalization:</strong> Integration of India's economy with the global market.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Impact of Economic Reforms:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher economic growth and increase in GDP.</li>
            <li>Increase in foreign direct investment (FDI).</li>
            <li>Growth in private sector and job opportunities.</li>
            <li>Reduction in trade barriers and increase in exports.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Challenges of Economic Reforms:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased income inequality.</li>
            <li>Job insecurity in some sectors.</li>
            <li>Dependence on foreign investments.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Current Challenges Facing the Indian Economy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> Despite economic growth, job creation has not kept pace with the increasing workforce. (Naye rozgar utne nahi bane jitni zarurat thi.)</li>
            <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Rising prices of essential commodities affect the purchasing power of people. (Mehngai badhne se logon ki kharidne ki shamta prabhavit hoti hai.)</li>
            <li><strong>Poverty & Income Inequality:</strong> The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. (Ameer aur gareeb ke beech antar badhta ja raha hai.)</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Distress:</strong> Farmers face issues like low productivity, price fluctuations, and lack of modern technology. (Kisano ko fasal ke sahi daam nahi milte aur naye techniques ki kami hai.)</li>
            <li><strong>Fiscal Deficit:</strong> Government expenditure often exceeds revenue, leading to borrowing and increasing debt. (Sarkar ka kharcha aamdani se zyada hota hai, is wajah se udhaar lena padta hai.)</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Concerns:</strong> Industrialization and urbanization have led to pollution, deforestation, and climate change. (Vikas ke saath-pradushan aur prakritik sampada ka bhi nuksan ho raha hai.)</li>
            <li><strong>Banking & Financial Sector Issues:</strong> Non-performing assets (NPAs) and loan defaults put pressure on banks. (Banks ke adhikaran loan wapas nahi milte jo banking system ko kamzor banate hain.)</li>
            <li><strong>Global Economic Uncertainty:</strong> Trade wars, recession fears, and geopolitical tensions affect India's economic stability. (Vishwa arthvyavastha ke uthal puthal ka Bharat par bhi prabhav padta hai.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Development Experience of India â€“ A Comparison with Neighbours</h2>
        <p>India's development experience is often compared with that of its neighboring countries, particularly China and Pakistan. (Bharat ki vikas yatra ka tulnatmak adhyayan China aur Pakistan ke sath kiya jata hai.)</p>
        
        <h2>Comparison Factors:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GDP Growth:</strong> China has shown the highest growth, followed by India, while Pakistan lags. (China ki arthvyavastha sabse tez badhi, Bharat dusre sthaan par hai, aur Pakistan piche raha.)</li>
            <li><strong>Industrialization:</strong> China has a strong manufacturing sector, whereas India and Pakistan still rely more on agriculture and services. (China ka manufacturing sector bahut majboot hai, jabki Bharat aur Pakistan ab bhi agriculture aur services par adharit hain.)</li>
            <li><strong>Human Development:</strong> China leads in education and healthcare, while India has improved significantly, and Pakistan faces challenges. (China shiksha aur swasthya me aage hai, Bharat ne sudhar kiya hai, aur Pakistan abhi bhi struggles kar raha hai.)</li>
            <li><strong>Poverty Reduction:</strong> China has drastically reduced poverty, India has seen gradual improvement, and Pakistan struggles with economic instability. (China ne garibi bahut kam ki hai, Bharat me dheere sudhar ho raha hai, aur Pakistan arthik asuraksha se juj raha hai.)</li>
        </ul>
