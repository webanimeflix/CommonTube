        <h1>Determination of Income and Employment - Detailed Summary</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Concept of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply:</strong> Aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for goods and services in an economy, while aggregate supply (AS) is the total supply of goods and services produced. (AD matlab jitna demand hai aur AS matlab jitna supply hai.)</p>
        
        <h2>Components of Aggregate Demand:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consumption Expenditure (C):</strong> Spending by households on goods and services.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Expenditure (I):</strong> Spending by businesses on capital goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Expenditure (G):</strong> Spending by the government on public services.</li>
            <li><strong>Net Exports (X - M):</strong> Exports minus imports.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Equilibrium Level of Income:</h2>
        <p>Equilibrium occurs when aggregate demand equals aggregate supply (AD = AS). This determines the national income and employment level. (Jab demand aur supply barabar hoti hai tab equilibrium hota hai.)</p>
        
        <h2>Multiplier Effect:</h2>
        <p>Multiplier shows how an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in national income. It is calculated as 1 / (1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. (Agar koi zyada kharche kare toh income bhi badhti hai, isko multiplier kehte hain.)</p>
        
        <h2>Problems of Unemployment:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unemployment leads to poverty and lower standard of living.</li>
            <li>It reduces national income and economic growth.</li>
            <li>High unemployment leads to social and political instability.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Government Measures to Increase Employment:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Increasing government expenditure.</li>
            <li>Encouraging private sector investment.</li>
            <li>Providing skill training and education.</li>
            <li>Promoting small-scale industries.</li>
        </ul>
